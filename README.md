# Holt 

Holt is an early-stage interactive application and rendering engine. I use it to learn how to create modern applications, focusing on computer graphics. 
I draw knowledge from [TheCherno](https://github.com/TheCherno), who runs a greate YouTube channel with his [Game Engine](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) series and I explore various corners of the internet for additional insights.

## Build
Clone the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/wooodiest/Holt`

Project tested in Visual Studio 2022, currently works only for Windows. To generate the project run `Win-GenProjects.bat` found in `scripts` folder.
